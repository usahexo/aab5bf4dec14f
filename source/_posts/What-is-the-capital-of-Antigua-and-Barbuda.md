#  What is Picasso's most famous painting?

There is no definitive answer to this question as Picasso created so many famous and renowned paintings over the course of his career. However, one of the paintings that is often cited as Picasso's most famous work is his painting entitled Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which was completed in 1907.

This painting is particularly notable due to the unique and groundbreaking approach that Picasso took with its creation. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon features five nude female figures who are depicted as having African features. This was a highly controversial move at the time, as it broke with traditional conventions regarding how people of color were portrayed in art.

Despite the initial backlash that Les Demoiselles d'Avignon received, the painting has gone on to become one of the most celebrated and well-known pieces of art in history. It has been exhibited all over the world and has been the subject of numerous critical essays and studies. In addition, it has been reproduced on countless occasions, making it one of the most recognizable images in modern art.
