#  Arkansas legislative panel approves sports betting bill

#

# A legislative panel in Arkansas has approved a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The proposal now moves on to the full House of Representatives for consideration.

#

# If passed, Arkansas would become the latest state to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Other states, including Michigan and Illinois, are considering similar proposals.

#

# Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it would generate new revenue for the state government. They also point to evidence that shows sports betting is already taking place in Arkansas, and that regulating and taxing it would allow the state to capture some of that revenue.

#

# Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills. They also claim that it would not generate as much revenue as supporters claim, and that it would be difficult to enforce.

#  Arkansas becomes fourth state to approve sports betting

Arkansas became the fourth state in the US to approve sports betting on Thursday, following months of intense debate over how much oversight the new industry should have.

Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a bill into law that will allow casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, with regulations set by the Arkansas Racing Commission.

“It is important that we act quickly to provide this new form of entertainment to our citizens and to position Arkansas as a destination for sports gaming,” Hutchinson said in a statement.

The law, which takes effect in August, stipulates that bets must be placed through the facilities’ websites or mobile apps, rather than through bookmakers. It also prohibits Arkansans from gambling on high school, college and professional games played in the state.

In addition to Arkansas, sports betting is now legal in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The industry is expected to generate nearly $6 billion in revenue nationwide this year, according to research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC.

#  Arkansas lawmakers pass sports betting bill

Arkansas lawmakers have voted to allow sports betting in the state, becoming the latest to do so after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity last year.

The bill, which was approved on Wednesday, allows for bets to be placed at casinos and racetracks, with the Arkansas Racing Commission given regulatory authority.

It now goes to Governor Asa Hutchinson, who is expected to sign it into law.

“I am glad that the legislature has passed a bill authorizing sports betting in Arkansas,” Hutchinson said in a statement.

“This legislation will provide an additional option for Arkansans who enjoy gambling and will bring additional revenues to our state. I look forward to signing this bill into law.”

Arkansas is now the 27th US state to legalize some form of sports betting since the May 2018 Supreme Court ruling.

#  Bill allowing Arkansas sports betting heads to governor's desk

Arkansas is on the verge of becoming the latest state to allow sports betting, after the state legislature approved a bill allowing it on Wednesday.

The bill, which passed the House and Senate by wide margins, now goes to Gov. Asa Hutchinson for his signature. Hutchinson has said he supports sports betting and is expected to sign the bill into law.

Under the proposed law, bets could be placed at casinos, racetracks and other approved locations in Arkansas. The state would also partner with established gaming companies to offer mobile sports betting.

Revenue from sports betting would be used to fund college scholarships and other state initiatives.

Arkansas is the latest in a series of states that have moved to legalize sports betting in recent months. New Jersey became the first state to allow sports betting outside of Nevada in June, followed by Delaware, Mississippi and West Virginia. More states are expected to follow suit in the coming months.

The rapid expansion of legal sports betting comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on a case that could overturn a federal ban on most sports betting nationwide. The court is expected to announce its decision in the next few weeks.

#  Governor signs Arkansas sports betting bill into law

Arkansas is now the latest state to legalize sports betting, as Governor Asa Hutchinson has signed a bill into law that allows sportsbooks to open in the state.

The law allows for both on- and off-track betting, as well as mobile betting, and it will be up to the Arkansas Racing Commission to decide which casinos will be able to offer sports betting. The commission is also responsible for developing regulations for the industry.

While there are still some logistical details to iron out, such as what types of bets will be allowed and what age group will be able to place them, officials believe that sports betting could be up and running in Arkansas by the end of the year.

This is welcome news for casino operators in Arkansas, who have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of sports betting. The industry is expected to generate nearly $10 million in revenue each year, which will help offset some of the losses that casinos have been experiencing in recent years.

Arkansas is just the latest state to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi. With more states likely to legalize sports betting in the coming year, it's clear that this is an industry that is here to stay.
