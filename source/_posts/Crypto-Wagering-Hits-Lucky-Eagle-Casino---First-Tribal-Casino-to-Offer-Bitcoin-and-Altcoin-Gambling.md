#  Crypto Wagering Hits Lucky Eagle Casino - First Tribal Casino to Offer Bitcoin and Altcoin Gambling

Cryptocurrency gambling has arrived in the US, and it’s making its first mark on the Wild West of American gambling: tribal casinos. The Lucky Eagle Casino in Rochester, Washington has announced that it will be the first tribal casino to offer bitcoin and altcoin gambling.

The news was not a total surprise; the tribe that owns the casino had hinted back in February that they were looking into crypto gambling. But this is still seen as a watershed moment for crypto in the US.

The Lucky Eagle is not just any old casino; it’s one of the largest and most popular tribal casinos in the country. It’s also one of the most profitable, with revenues of over $800 million last year. So if any casino can make crypto gambling work, it’s probably this one.

The Lucky Eagle is partnering up with crypto gaming startup Bit8 to offer its games. Bit8 is an established player in the crypto gaming world, with a long track record of providing white-label services to major casinos around the world. So even if you’re not inside the Lucky Eagle Casino itself, you may still have a chance to try your hand at crypto gambling.

What games are available? The Lucky Eagle is initially offering five different types of bitcoin and altcoin gambling: blackjack, roulette, baccarat, craps, and slots. All of these games are available both online and at the casino itself; all you need is a phone or computer with an internet connection and a Bitcoin or altcoin wallet.

For those interested in trying their hand at some serious Crypto Wagering,, Blackjack offers relatively good odds for players when compared to other casino games (average house edge is about 1%). Baccarat also has relatively low odds for players at about 1.5%. Craps offers some of the best chances for players with an average house edge of only 1%. Slots have an average house edge of about 3%, but this varies depending on the game you choose to play
