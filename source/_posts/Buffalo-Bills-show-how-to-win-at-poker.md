#  Buffalo Bills show how to win at poker

The Buffalo Bills were one of the most successful NFL teams of the early 1990s. Led by quarterback Jim Kelly and head coach Marv Levy, the Bills reached the playoffs in seven consecutive seasons, and made four appearances in the Super Bowl.

One of the reasons for the Bills’ success was their ability to win at poker. In a sport where teams often have to make quick decisions under pressure, the Bills were able to stay calm and make the right plays.

Some of the team’s poker skills can be seen in their playoff victory over the Miami Dolphins in 1992. With just seconds left on the clock and the Bills down by three points, quarterback Jim Kelly drove his team downfield and threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Don Beebe to win the game.

This was an impressive feat, but it was made even more impressive by the fact that Beebe had only been in the game because of an injury to wide receiver James Lofton. Lofton was one of Buffalo’s best players, so it was a huge gamble for Kelly to put Beebe in instead.

But Kelly knew that Beebe was a good poker player, and he trusted him to make a big play when it mattered most. And that’s exactly what Beebe did, catching a touchdown pass in the final seconds to give Buffalo’s fans something to cheer about.

The Buffalo Bills have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past two decades. Many have wondered what their secret to success is, and now we may have an answer.

It turns out that the Bills’ winning poker strategy is what has set them apart from other teams. In a recent interview, Bills head coach Sean McDermott revealed some of the team’s secrets.

“Poker is all about making good decisions, and that’s something we focus on as a team,” McDermott said. “We make sure that we’re always thinking about the best decision for our team, and not just for ourselves. That’s helped us win a lot of games over the years.”

The Bills got their start in poker in the early 1990s, when then-head coach Marv Levy brought in professional poker player Phil Hellmuth to help teach the game to the players. Hellmuth was impressed with how well the Bills played, and he quickly became a big fan of the team.

Since then, the Bills have continued to use poker as a way to sharpen their skills and stay ahead of the competition. And it seems to be working; they’ve made it to the playoffs six times in the past 10 years.

So if you want to learn how to win like the Bills, here are a few tips from Coach McDermott:

1) Stay focused on your goals and objectives.

2) Make sure you understand your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses.

3) Be prepared to make quick decisions based on the situation at hand.

4) Don’t be afraid to take risks if it means winning more games.
