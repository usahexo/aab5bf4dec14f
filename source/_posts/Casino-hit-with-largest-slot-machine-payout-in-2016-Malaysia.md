This latest win comes as a welcome boost to Malaysia’s casino industry, which has seen revenues decline in recent years due to falling tourist numbers and tighter regulations.

#  Casino pays out record slot machine jackpot in Malaysia

A casino in Malaysia has paid out a record slot machine jackpot, just two weeks after it opened. The jackpot, which was worth almost $2.5 million, was won by a local woman who had only been playing the machines for a few minutes.

The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was celebrating her birthday at the casino when she hit the jackpot. She said that she could not believe it when she saw the display flashing "Jackpot - $2,492,171".

"I screamed and everyone around me started applauding," she said. "It was such an incredible feeling."

The previous record for a slot machine jackpot in Malaysia was $2.2 million, which was won by a British tourist in 2016.

#  Slot machine payout at Malaysian casino reaches new milestone

Slot machine payout at a Malaysian casino has reached a new milestone, with gamers walking away with almost MYR 1 million (USD 234,000) in winnings in just one day.

The lucky punters were playing games such as “Dragon Link”, “Wonder 4” and “Fortune Pai Gow” when they hit the jackpot.

According to casino officials, the highest payout was for MYR 208,000 (USD 49,000), which was won on a “Wonder 4” machine.

Other major payouts included MYR 179,000 (USD 42,000) on a “Dragon Link” machine and MYR 152,000 (USD 36,00) on a “Fortune Pai Gow” machine.

The milestone comes as no surprise to many industry insiders who have long touted Malaysia as one of the most lucrative gambling markets in the world. This is thanks to the country’s large population and relatively loose gambling laws.

Casinos in Malaysia are allowed to offer slot machines and electronic table games, with players able to wager up to MYR 3,000 (USD 715) per game. The only type of casino game that is currently prohibited is poker.

As a result, there are now dozens of casinos scattered across the country, each vying for a slice of the lucrative market. This has led to some impressive payouts over the years and it looks like this trend is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
