<h1 id="How-to-calculate-sports-betting-chances-for-dummies"><a href="#How-to-calculate-sports-betting-chances-for-dummies" class="headerlink" title="How to calculate sports betting chances for dummies"></a>How to calculate sports betting chances for dummies</h1><p>If you are not familiar with sports betting and would like to learn how to calculate betting chances, this is the article for you. The following will explain three popular methods of calculating chances: decimal, fractional and American.</p>
<p>To understand decimal chances, think about a basketball game in which Team A is playing Team B. In order to calculate the decimal chance of Team A winning, divide 1 by the total number of possible outcomes. In this example there are two possible outcomes: Team A wins or Team B wins. 1 divided by 2 equals 0.5 or 50%. This means that there is a 50% chance that Team A will win the game. </p>
<p>To calculate fractional chances, think about the same basketball game mentioned above but suppose that Team A is playing Team C instead of Team B. In order to calculate the fractional chance of Team A winning,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> divide 1 by the total number of possible outcomes. Just as before, there are two possible outcomes: Team A wins orTeam B wins. 1 divided by 2 equals .5 or 50%. However, because fractions are always expressed as two numbers separated by a slash (&#x2F;), the fractional chance for this particular example would be written as 1&#x2F;2 or 50%. This means that there is a 50% chance that Team A will win the game. </p>
<p>To calculate American chances, think about a different basketball game in which team D is playing team E. In order to calculate the American chance of team D winning, take the decimal chance and multiply it by 100 (just to make it easier). So in our example .5 x 100 &#x3D; 50%. This means that there is a 50% chance that team D will win the game. </p>
<p>Some people find American chances simpler to understand than decimal or fractional chances because they are just percentages expressed as whole numbers (100%, 75%, etc). However, others find them more difficult because they involve addition and multiplication (which some people find confusing). Fractional and decimal chances are both based on division so they can be tricky for some people at first too; but many find them more straightforward once they get used to them.</p>
<h1 id="Understand-sports-betting-odds-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide"><a href="#Understand-sports-betting-odds-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide" class="headerlink" title="Understand sports betting odds in minutes with this simple guide"></a>Understand sports betting odds in minutes with this simple guide</h1><p>Most people who bet on sports don’t understand the odds. They see a number like -180 and think that the better is a shoo-in. This could not be further from the truth!</p>
<p>In this article, we will explain what sports betting odds mean and how to read them. By understanding how the odds work, you can make smarter bets and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>The most common type of sports betting odds are fractions. For example, you might see a line like “Boston Celtics +7”. This means that the Celtics are an underdog and they are receiving 7 points from the bookie. To break this down even further, let’s say the Celtics are playing against the Golden State Warriors. If you bet on Boston and they lose by 6 points or less, then you would win your bet. On the other hand, if they lose by more than 7 points then you would lose your bet.</p>
<p>Another common type of sports betting odds are decimal odds. They work in a similar way to fractions, but they use decimals instead of fractions (e.g. 1.85). As with fractions, decimal odds tell you how much you will win on a successful bet (relative to your stake). So, if you put €10 on Boston at 1.85 decimal odds and they win, then you would receive €18.50 back (€10 x 1.85 &#x3D; €18.50).</p>
<p>It’s important to note that bookmakers often change their odds depending on how likely they think each outcome is. So, for example, the Warriors might be listed as -200 favourites against the Celtics when the game first starts, but this number may change as money is wagered on either side.</p>
<p>Now that we have explained how sports betting odds work, let’s take a look at some examples:</p>
<p>Fractional Odds Decimal Odds Example 1&#x2F;2 1.50 Manchester City to beat Manchester United 3&#x2F;1 4.00 Liverpool to beat Tottenham Hotspur 7&#x2F;2 3.50 Chelsea to beat Arsenal 2&#x2F;9 1.11 Southampton to beat Crystal Palace 5&#x2F;1 6.00 Everton to beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</p>
<p>As we can see from the table above, fractional and decimal odds offer different payouts depending on how likely each outcome is deemed to be by the bookmaker(s). It’s important to understand which type of odds are being used in order to calculate potential returns correctly (which we will cover in more detail shortly).</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<pre><code>  Sports betting odds tell you how likely an event is to happen and how much you stand to win if it does happen The two most common types of sports betting odds are fractions and decimals Fractions use numbers like 1/2 or 3/1 to represent how much money you will win on a successful bet Decimal Odds use numbers like 1.50 or 4.00

<h1 id="Know-thy-chances-understanding-sports-betting-probabilities"><a href="#Know-thy-chances-understanding-sports-betting-probabilities" class="headerlink" title="Know thy chances: understanding sports betting probabilities"></a>Know thy chances: understanding sports betting probabilities</h1><p><em>It is critical for any aspiring sports bettor to understand betting probabilities. Probabilities provide a snapshot of the likelihood that an event will occur.</em></p>
<p>For instance, if you want to bet on a team to win a game, you need to know what the probability is that the team will actually win. This is because different sports betting odds reflect these probabilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are looking to make money from sports betting, it’s important to understand how betting odds work – and how to convert them into probabilities._</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore how to calculate betting odds and probabilities for several different types of bets. We will also look at some examples to help illustrate how these concepts work.</p>
<p>So let’s get started!_</p>
<h3 id="How-do-bookmakers-set-odds"><a href="#How-do-bookmakers-set-odds" class="headerlink" title="How do bookmakers set odds?"></a>How do bookmakers set odds?</h3><p>Bookmakers set odds by estimating the probability of an event occurring. They then set their odds in order to ensure they make a profit regardless of the outcome of the event.</p>
<p>This means that for any given bet, there is usually a favourite (who has the lowest odds) and an underdog (who has the highest odds). The bookmaker’s goal is to ensure that they make more money from bets on the favourite than they lose from bets on the underdog.</p>
<p>We can calculate Bookmaker’s margin by subtracting the Odds on the Underdog from 1 (or 100%). So for our earlier example: Margin &#x3D; 1 - Odds  Underdog . So with Odds at 2:1, Margin &#x3D; 1- (2&#x2F;1) &#x3D; 33%. This number reflects how much profit the bookmaker makes on average for every dollar wagered on this event. </p>
<p> So now that we understand how bookmakers set their odds, let’s take a look at how we can convert them into probabilities…_</p>
<h3 id="Converting-Odds-into-Probabilities"><a href="#Converting-Odds-into-Probabilities" class="headerlink" title="Converting Odds into Probabilities"></a>Converting Odds into Probabilities</h3><p>  In order to convert betting odds into probabilities, we first need to understand what each number represents. As shown in the table above, decimal odds represent fractions expressed as decimals (e.g 2&#x2F;1 would be 1.5 in decimal form). Implied Probability shows us what percentage of chance the bookmaker thinks an event has of taking place (e.g If Odds are 2&#x2F;1 then Implied Probability is 33%). Payout tells us how much we would receive if we placed a $100 wager on this event and won (e.g If Payout is $200 then you would receive $300 back including your initial stake). Finally, our Wager shows us how much money we would need to risk in order to win $100 (e.g If Wager is 10 then you would need to risk $10).</p>
<p>Now that we have all this information at our disposal, let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<p> In this example we will be converting decimal odds of 5&#x2F;2 into implied probabilities._   Let’s start by calculating our Wager by dividing our Payout ($200) by our Odds ($5&#x2F;2) which gives us 10 as our Wager amount..</p>
<p> Now that we know our Wager amount, let’s find out how much money we need to risk in order to win $100. To do this, we simply multiply our Wager ($10) by 100 which gives us 1000 as our required Risk amount..</p>
<p> Finally, let’s calculate our Implied Probability by divide 1 by our Odds ($5&#x2F;2) which gives us 50% as our Implied Probability..</p>
<p> As you can see, with decimal odds it is relatively easy convert them into percentages - all you need are basic maths skills! <em>Now that we have covered converting betting odds into probabilities, let’s take a look at different types of bets and see how these conversions work.</em></p>
<h3 id="Straight-up-Bets"><a href="#Straight-up-Bets" class="headerlink" title="Straight-up Bets"></a>Straight-up Bets</h3><p>A straight-up bet is a wager on who will win or lose a particular match or game outright. For instance, in a tennis match between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, if you think Nadal will win then your straight-up bet would be on him.. In most cases with straight-up bets, there are only two possible outcomes - either your team wins or they lose - so there is no need convert decimal odds into percentages.. Simply finding which team has lower decimal odds offers us our winning probability.._ Let’s take another example: NBA Finals 2017 matchup between Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers… In this example Warriors are favourites with 1&#x2F;4 decimal Odds while Cavaliers are underdogs with 5&#x2F;2 decimal Odds._ as Warriors have lower decimal Odds than Cavaliers ,the probability for Warriors winning is higher .<em>. So if you think that Golden State Warriors will beat Cleveland Cavaliers in NBA Finals 2017 , your best option would be placing a straight up bet on them ..</em></p>

If you’re new to sports betting, it’s important to learn the basics before placing any bets. In this article, we’ll teach you how to win at sports betting by providing some basic tips and advice.</p>
<h1 id="Start-by-studying-the-odds"><a href="#Start-by-studying-the-odds" class="headerlink" title="Start by studying the odds"></a>Start by studying the odds</h1><p>One of the most important things you can do when betting on sports is to study the odds.
