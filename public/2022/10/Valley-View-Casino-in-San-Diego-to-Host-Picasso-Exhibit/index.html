<p>The Valley View Casino said in a statement that the painting was selected because of its “unique perspective and distinctive style.” The casino also noted that the painting is considered to be one of Picasso’s early masterpieces.</p>
<p>La Coiffeuse is currently on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, but it will be moving to the Valley View Casino in early 2019. The casino plans to put the painting on display in its Pavilion Gallery, where it will be available for public viewing.</p>

<p>Picasso was one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. He helped to develop Cubism, a revolutionary approach to painting that shattered traditional notions of perspective and broke down the boundaries between different artistic media. He also produced a vast body of sculpture, prints, and drawings, as well as some of the most famous paintings of all time, including “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” and “Guernica.”</p>
<p>The Valley View Casino exhibit provides a rare opportunity for visitors to see many of Picasso’s greatest works in one place. It covers his early years in Spain, his experiments with Cubism, his wartime exile in Paris, and his final years in southern France.

<p>Picasso was born in 1881 in Málaga, Andalusia. He began painting when he was only a teenager and quickly developed a unique style that would come to be known around the world. He was passionate about art and worked relentlessly to create new and innovative pieces.</p>
