The Lucky Eagle Casino in Rochester, Washington has announced that it will be the first tribal casino to offer bitcoin and altcoin gambling.</p>
<p>The news was not a total surprise; the tribe that owns the casino had hinted back in February that they were looking into crypto gambling. But this is still seen as a watershed moment for crypto in the US.</p>
<p>The Lucky Eagle is not just any old casino; it’s one of the largest and most popular tribal casinos in the country. It’s also one of the most profitable, with revenues of over $800 million last year. So if any casino can make crypto gambling work, it’s probably this one.</p>
<p>The Lucky Eagle is partnering up with crypto gaming startup Bit8 to offer its games. Bit8 is an established player in the crypto gaming world, with a long track record of providing white-label services to major casinos around the world. So even if you’re not inside the Lucky Eagle Casino itself, you may still have a chance to try your hand at crypto gambling.</p>
<p>What games are available? The Lucky Eagle is initially offering five different types of bitcoin and altcoin gambling: blackjack, roulette, baccarat, craps, and slots. All of these games are available both online and at the casino itself; all you need is a phone or computer with an internet connection and a Bitcoin or altcoin wallet.</p>
<p>For those interested in trying their hand at some serious Crypto Wagering,, Blackjack offers relatively good odds for players when compared to other casino games (average house edge is about 1%). Baccarat also has relatively low odds for players at about 1.5%. Craps offers some of the best chances for players with an average house edge of only 1%. Slots have an average house edge of about 3%, but this varies depending on the game you choose to play</p>
