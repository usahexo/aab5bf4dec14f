And what better way to make your get-together even more special than by playing Fiji poker?</p>
<p>This variant of the classic card game is perfect for any occasion, and it’s easy to learn how to play. Here are the basics:</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt five cards, face down. The remainder of the cards are placed in the middle of the table, face down. These cards are called the “flop.”</p>
<p>The player to the left of the dealer starts the action by betting either one or two chips. The next player then has two choices: They can either match the bet or raise it. If they choose to raise, then they must put in at least two chips more than the previous bettor. This process continues until all players have either folded or raised.</p>
<p>After all bets have been made, the dealer flips over the next three cards (the turn and river). These cards are used to determine the winning hand. The player with the best hand wins all of the chips on the table. If there is a tie, then the pot is split evenly among all players involved in the tie.</p>
<p>Here are some basic hands that you can use to help you win big at Fiji poker:</p>
<p>One pair: Two cards of the same rank. For example, two queens or two fives.</p>
<p>Two pair: Two different pairs of cards. For example, two kings and two sixes.</p>
<p>Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank. For example, three eights or three jacks.</p>
<p>Straight: Five consecutive cards of any suit. For example, nine of clubs, ten of diamonds, jack of spades, queen of hearts, ace of clubs.</p>
<p>Flush: All five cards belonging to one particular suit. For example, all clubs or all diamonds.</p>
<h1 id="Win-Money-and-have-Fun-with-Fiji-Casino-Poker"><a href="#Win-Money-and-have-Fun-with-Fiji-Casino-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Win Money and have Fun with Fiji Casino Poker"></a>Win Money and have Fun with Fiji Casino Poker</h1><p>There is no arguing that Fiji Casino Poker is one of the most thrilling and profitable online casino games around. The premise is simple – players are dealt five cards, after which they must decide to either “fold” their hand or continue playing by placing a bet that is twice the size of the last bet made. At this point, three cards are revealed in the middle of the table (the flop), and players must determine whether they want to continue betting or not. If they do, then another card is revealed (the turn) and they again have to choose whether to bet or not. Finally, the river card is revealed and players either show their cards or muck them. The player with the best five-card poker hand (based on traditional poker rankings) wins the pot.</p>
<p>What really makes Fiji Casino Poker so much fun is that there are so many opportunities to win big pots. Because the game moves along at a fast pace, there is always plenty of action and you never know when you might hit a royal flush! In addition, since Fiji Casino Poker uses a random number generator (RNG), you can be assured that every game is completely fair and unbiased. So if you’re looking for some excitement and want a chance to win some money too, be sure to check out Fiji Casino Poker!</p>

<h1 id="Exciting-Times-Ahead-Fiji-Hold’em-is-Taking-the-World-by-Storm"><a href="#Exciting-Times-Ahead-Fiji-Hold’em-is-Taking-the-World-by-Storm" class="headerlink" title="Exciting Times Ahead: Fiji Hold’em is Taking the World by Storm"></a>Exciting Times Ahead: Fiji Hold’em is Taking the World by Storm</h1><p>It seems that every day there is a new online poker game or variation popping up on the internet. While this variety is great for players, it can make it difficult to determine which games are worth your time. That’s why we’re here to tell you all about Fiji Hold’em – a game that is quickly gaining popularity among online poker players.</p>
<p>What is Fiji Hold’em? </p>
<p>Fiji Hold’em is a variant of Texas Hold’em that was created in 2009 by Australian poker pro David Steicke and has been growing in popularity ever since. The game is played with the same 52 cards as Texas Hold’em, but there are a few differences in the way the hands are ranked and the betting rounds work. For example, while both games use a flop, turn and river, the order in which they are revealed differs. In Fiji Hold’em, the flop comes first, followed by the turn and then the river. This change makes for some different strategic considerations when playing the game.</p>
<p>How to Play </p>
<p>The basic goal of Fiji Hold’em is the same as Texas Hold’em – to make the best possible five card hand using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards on the table. However, as mentioned above, there are a few differences in how hands are ranked and how bets are placed. Here’s a quick rundown: </p>
<ol>
<li>The rank of hands is slightly different in Fiji Hold’em than in Texas Hold’em. In particular, straights and flushes are not as powerful, and pairs are weaker than they would be in Texas Hold’em. </li>
<li>There are four betting rounds in Fiji Hold’EM – preflop, flop, turn and river. The amount that can be bet during each round also varies depending on the stage of the hand. </li>
<li>In Fiji Hold’EM, players can only use one of their two hole cards to make their hand (unlike Texas where players can use both hole cards). 4) The player who makes the best five card hand using their two hole cards and the five community cards wins the pot.</li>
</ol>
